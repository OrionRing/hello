      <b>The Komodo dragon <i>(Varanus komodoensis)</i></b> a, also known as the
      <b> <u>Komodo monitor</u></b>, is a large reptile of the
      <a href="https://shorturl.at/wkKWg" target="_blank">monitor lizard</a>
      family
      <a href="https://shorturl.at/thAMX" target="_blank">Varanidae</a> that is

      It is

        >the largest extant species of lizard,</a

      As a result of their size, Komodo dragons are
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_predators" target="_blank"
        >apex predators,</a

      and dominate the

      >
      in which they live. Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including

      birds, and

      >
      Komodo dragons' group behavior in hunting is exceptional in the reptile
      world. The diet of Komodo dragons mainly consists of

      Mating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September;
      as many as 20 eggs are deposited at a time in an abandoned

      nest or in a self-dug nesting hole. The eggs are incubated for seven to
      eight months, hatching in April, when insects are most plentiful. Young
      Komodo dragons are vulnerable and dwell in trees to avoid predators, such

      adults, which young Komodo dragons also try to repel by rolling in feces.
      They take 8 to 9 years to mature and are estimated to live up to 30 years.

      Komodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910. Their
      large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits. In the
      wild, their range has been reduced by human encroachment and is likely to
      contract further from the effects of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change" target="_blank"

    <h2>Taxonomic history</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>Komodo dragons were first documented by Europeans in 1910, when rumors of a "land crocodile" reached Lieutenant van Steyn van Hensbroek of the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies" target="_blank">Dutch colonial</a> administration.<sup>[5]</sup> Widespread notoriety came after 1912, when 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ouwens" target="_blank">Peter Ouwens,</a> the director of the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoological_Museum_of_Bogor" target="_blank">Zoological Museum of Bogor,</a> 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java" target="_blank">Java,</a> published a paper on the topic after receiving a photo and a skin from the lieutenant, as well as two other specimens from a collector. <sup>[4]</sup></p>

    <p>The first two live Komodo dragons to arrive in Europe were exhibited in the Reptile House at 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Zoo" target="_blank">London Zoo</a> when it opened in 1927. <sup>[6]</sup> 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Beauchamp_Procter" target="_blank">Joan Beauchamp Procter</a> made some of the earliest observations of these animals in captivity and she demonstrated their behaviour at a scientific meeting of the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoological_Society_of_London" target="_blank">Zoological Society of London in 1928.</a><sup>[7]</sup></p>

    <p>The Komodo dragon was the driving factor for an expedition to 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komodo_(island)" target="_blank">Komodo Island</a> by W. Douglas Burden in 1926. After returning with 12 preserved specimens and two live ones, this expedition provided the inspiration for the 1933 movie 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_(1933_film)" target="_blank">King Kong.</a><sup>[8]</sup> It was also Burden who coined the common name "Komodo dragon".
        <sup>[9]</sup> Three of his specimens were stuffed and are still on display in the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History" target="_blank">American Museum of Natural History.</a><sup>[10]</sup></p>

        <p>The Dutch island administration, realizing the limited number of individuals in the wild, soon outlawed sport hunting and heavily limited the number of individuals taken for scientific study. Collecting expeditions ground to a halt with the occurrence of World War II, not resuming until the 1950s and 1960s, when studies examined the Komodo dragon's feeding behavior, reproduction, and body temperature. At around this time, an expedition was planned in which a long-term study of the Komodo dragon would be undertaken. This task was given to the Auffenberg family, who stayed on Komodo Island for 11 months in 1969. During their stay, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Auffenberg" target="_blank">Walter Auffenberg</a> and his assistant Putra Sastrawan captured and tagged more than 50 Komodo dragons. <sup>[11]</sup></p>

            <p>Research from the Auffenberg expedition proved enormously influential in raising Komodo dragons in captivity. <sup>[12]</sup> Research after that of the Auffenberg family has shed more light on the nature of the Komodo dragon, with biologists such as Claudio Ciofi continuing to study the creatures.<sup>[13]</sup></p>
